<h2>Mount Clonezilla image</h2>

One important feature that Clonezilla does not offer out of the box is browsing images to restore single files. You can only restore complete partitions or drives. But there is a way around this, with the shortcoming that it requires time and disk space...

<h3>Create the iso</h3>
First, we need to restore an image from the different *.gz files. This can be done inline with the following command:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-text">
touch /path_to_new_image/partition.img # create the empty file first
cat /path-to-clonezilla-images/your_partition.ptcl-img.gz.*
	| gzip -d -c
	| partclone.restore -C -s - -O /path_to_new_image/partition.img
</pre>

The output should be like this:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-text">
Starting to restore image (-) to device (partition.img)
Calculating bitmap... Please wait... done!
File system:  EXTFS
Device size:  447.7 GB = 109296383 Blocks
Space in use: 351.6 GB = 85836599 Blocks
Free Space:    96.1 GB = 23459784 Blocks
Block size:   4096 Byte
Elapsed: 02:26:11, Remaining: 00:00:00, Completed: 100.00%, Rate:   2.41GB/min, 
current block:  109056032, total block:  109296383, Complete: 100.00%           
Total Time: 02:26:11, Ave. Rate:    2.4GB/min, 100.00% completed!
Syncing... OK!
Partclone successfully restored the image (-) to the device (partition.img)
Cloned successfully.
</pre>

<h3>Mounting the image</h3>
Normally, a simple mount command is sufficient:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-text">
mkdir /media/lala # or any directory
sudo mount -o loop -t ext4 /path-to-new-image/partition.img /media/lala
</pre>

But if it gives you this error (like it systematically did for me):
<pre class="prettyprint lang-text">
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error

       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail or so.	
</pre>
And in dmesg:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-text">
...
[141057.090911] EXT4-fs (loop0): bad geometry: block count 29304832 
	exceeds size of device (28843552 blocks)
...
</pre>

Hopefully, there are a bunch of userful linux commands which deal with corrupted filesystem. 
First, we need to check the partition and then resize it so its size matches the one describer in the superblock:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-text">
# check the partition. Use fsck if you do not know the fs type
# -v : verbose, -f : force
fsck.ext4 -vf partition.img

# resize the partition. -f : force
resize2fs -f partition.img
</pre>

Then, try to mount it again and it should work.


Another idea is to restore the partition using a vm, but I haven't tried it yet.
