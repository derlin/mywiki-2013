###### install openvpn

Type `sudo apt-get install openvpn` in your terminal.

## Server-side

###### prepare your environment

Before generating the certificates, you will need to go through the following steps. Copy the easy-rsa examples:
```bash
 > cd /etc/openvpn
 > mkdir easy-rsa
 > cp -R /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0/\* easy-rsa/
```

Edit the global variables contained in `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars` according to your organization. You can set whatever you want (or leave it with defaults), but remember they will appear in your certificates! Finally, run the following:
```bash
> cd easy-rsa/
>. ./vars  # set environment variables
> ./clean-all
``` 

###### Generate the certificates

For the server, you will need the following:
```bash
# build the CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY (CA) cert/key
# this will create ca.crt and ca.key in the 
# /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys directory
> ./build-ca 

# (optional)
# build the INTERMEDIATE CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY cert/key
# this will create server.crt and server.key in the 
# /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys directory
> ./build-key-server server

# build BUILD DIFFIE-HELLMAN PARAMETERS 
# (necessary for the server end of a SSL/TLS connection)
> ./build-dh
```
    

For each client, you will also generate a distinct certificate:
```bash
> ./buil-key < the client name >
```    

Each client will have to copy the **ca.crt**, **clientname.crt** and **clientname.key** to its machine, in the `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys` directory.

###### Edit the configuration

Open the `/etc/openvpn/server.conf`:
```bash
# Config OpenVPN
# http://wiki.debian.org/OpenVPN

mode server
proto tcp
port 1154
dev tun

# specify the path to the files previously created
ca ca.crt
cert server.crt
key server.key
dh dh1024.pem
tls-auth ta.key 0

cipher AES-256-CBC

# specify the ip pool adress
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

# can maybe remove " bypass-dhcp"
# for routing to work, put this in /etc/rc.local:
# iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
# (wlan0 is my network interface going to 
# the Internet / gateway going to the Internet 172.16.0.3)

push "dhcp-option DNS 172.16.0.3"
keepalive 10 120

#user nobody
#group nogroup
#chroot /etc/openvpn/jail
persist-key
persist-tun
comp-lzo

verb 3
mute 20
status openvpn-status.log
log-append /var/log/openvpn.log
```
    

###### Final touch

Copy the following line in `/etc/rc.local`, just before `exit 0`:

```bash
# set eth0 or wlan0 depending of the interface you use
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
```  

Edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and uncomment the line:
```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

## Client side

The authentication is possible through the certificate previously generated. The client should thus have the following files in his machine:

*   `ca.crt`
*   `clientname.crt`
*   `clientname.key`
*   `ta.key`
*   a configuration file, see below

**On Linux**: install openvpn and run the following command:

```bash
# the file must imperatively end with .conf
> openvpn <path-to-client-config.conf>
```    

**On Windows**: isntall openvpnclient, copy the mentioned files in `Program Files/openvpn/config`. The configuration file must imperatively end with **.opvn**.

###### The configuration file

```bash
client 
dev tun
proto tcp-client

remote error418.no-ip.org 8989  # server's ip and port

resolv-retry infinite
cipher AES-256-CBC

# Keys and certificates
## !! relative path !!
ca       ca.crt
cert     clientname.crt    # replace clientname by your own
key      clientname.key
tls-auth ta.key 1

nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
comp-lzo
