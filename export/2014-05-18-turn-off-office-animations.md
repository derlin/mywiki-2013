2. Under Explore all settings, click Use the computer without a display.
3. Under Adjust time limits and flashing visuals, click Turn off all unnecessary animations (when possible).
4. Click OK.

To go even further:

1. open Microsoft Word
2. click of File > Options > Advanced
3. scroll to the display section
4. check "Disable hardware acceleration
5. uncheck "use subpixel positioning to smooth font on screen"
6. restart Microsoft Word
