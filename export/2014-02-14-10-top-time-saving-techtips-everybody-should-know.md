Based on the [Ted talk from David Pogue](https://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCsQtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Fdavid_pogue_10_top_time_saving_tech_tips.html&ei=2bv9UoqgAorg7QatiIB4&usg=AFQjCNE7AMaGf-z7lVpH6tDWoXI6C-6thQ&sig2=pmY16uVrw3zaJafd3Zuh0g&bvm=bv.61190604,d.ZGU), here is a list of really nice little features:

1. in browsers, don't use scrollbars. Instead, use space bar to scroll dwon, shift+space to scroll up
2. in forms, use the tab key to jump from box to box. If there is a popup menu, don't open it, but press the first letter over and over
3. in smartphones, a double tap on the space bar automatically adds the dot, the space and the capital letter
4. with smartphones, don't bother to go to contact to find out the most recent call. Instead, just press the call button: the latest number will show up!
5. In america, you can skip the voicemail message until the beep by pressing either "\*", "#" or another key depending on the calling carrier...
6. In google, type define + word to get a definition. You can also use google to find informations about flights (keyword "flight", but not sure it works abroad) and currencies/units conversions
7. double clic on a word will highlight it automatically, one more clic and the whole sentence will be selected. To replace text, don't bother to delete it, just type over it.
8. a camera needs time to compute the focus and exposure, adding a delay between the time the button is pressed and the photo is shot. To avoid that, you can pre-focus by half-pressing the button!
9. when giving a presentation (like powerpoint), pressing the letter B will toggle between a black screen and the actual slide. Pressing the W key does the same, but with a white screen
