## Fixing vim strange behavior

When using vim inside a screen session, I noticed two annoying things:

1. My color scheme disappreared
2. The console was not cleared after exiting vim (buffer full)

### The not-so-working solution from the internet

By default, screen is not configured to take advantage of the 256 color mode of the terminal. To change this behavior, I read throughout the internet that I could simply add those lines to my `.screenrc` file in my home directory:

```bash
# specify the term to use:
term screen-256color
# allow bold colors - necessary for some reason
attrcolor b ".I"
# tell screen how to set colors. AB = background, AF=foreground
termcapinfo xterm 'Co#256:AB=\E[48;5;%dm:AF=\E[38;5;%dm'
# use current bg color for erased chars
defbce on
```
This would normally fix the 256 color/vim scheme problem.

To fix the clear on exit problem, just add the following line to your .vimrc. It basically tells vim to clear the screen after close:
```
au VimLeave * :!clear
```

### The solution that worked for me

Even if for a lot of people this solution works, for me it was not enough: vim kept messing up with the colors, and my terminal had some strange behavior.

I finally got rid of all the problems by simply setting my `$TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color` instead of `xterm` (I added one line in my .zshrc).

With this change, when I launched the screen program, the TERM was correctly set to screen-256color.

So, finally, my `.screenrc` looks like:
```bash
# turn off the splash screen
startup_message off

# allow LESS to be launch in an overlay screen
altscreen

# specify the term to use, just in case
term screen-256color
```
